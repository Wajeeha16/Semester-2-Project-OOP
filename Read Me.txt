In order to load and compile the project, setup SDL2 and all its libraries by going into
project-> properties and then VCC directories chose all the include folders of the libraries.
Then go to linker and in additional libraries add all the libraries residing in x86 folder.
After that navigate to input and type in the names of all the libraries included in additional
dependencies. Now copy all the .dll files from the lib folder of the incuded libraries and copy
them into the debug folder of the project containing the .exe file.
Our setup for compilation is complete. Now after loading the project in VCC just build and run it in order to
compile it.
